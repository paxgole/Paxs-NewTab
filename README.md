### *How do I build one?*

I vaguely followed [this](https://executebig.notion.site/Building-a-New-Tab-page-d3cb4360ec90493c8c5aa0cb3570239e) tutorial for guidance as I had never built with Chrome's Extension API before. (Shoutout to [Execute Big](https://executebig.org/) for making cool resources and making them free! This one is from their project [Tech Roulette](https://techroulette.xyz/).)
I also vaguely referenced [this](https://hackernoon.com/building-a-new-tab-chrome-extension-with-zero-dependencies-5zlh3ue6) Hackernoon article by [Dane Lyons](https://hackernoon.com/u/Dane).
Chrome's [Extension Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/override/) for overriding the default newtab, bookmarks, and history pages are of course the bible here.
I used Figma to resize my art for the 16x16 and 128x128 icons required.
The ultimate resource for quickly checking your HTML and CSS is [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), IMO.

That being said, if you're looking for a quick fix and aren't big on writing your own extensions, you could make one with Google's own [no-code tool](https://tabmaker.withgoogle.com/).

### *How to set up this one?*

I decided to download Quill's package directly from [their website](https://quilljs.com/), which also contains pretty cool guides and a playground to modify the editor if you want. You can choose the CDN host or install it via npm, but you'll have to modify the files yourself.
